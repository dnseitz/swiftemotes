# Swiftemotes

An implementation of the [Motes Language](https://github.com/SteffenBlake/Motes) in Swift

Currently placeholder characters are used instead of actual emoticons, but eventually the
interpreter will be able to parse emotes

# Todo:
  - Evaluate function declarations before anything else so functions can be called before 
    they are declared
  - Implement emoticons for function calls rather than numbers.
